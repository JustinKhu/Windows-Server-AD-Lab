**Objective: Simulate common IT helpdesk tickets and issues that are commonly encountered in the workplace.**

**Tickets** 

**1. Scenario:** A user requests help as they are locked out of their account. 

**Solution:** Open ADUC and find the user account for the user. In this case 'Patty'. Open the menu for the user account and navigate to the 'account' tab. Check the box to unlock their account. 

**Verification:** In a real world example ask the user to try logging in again. In this scenario, attempted to login as 'Patty' on VM. 

**2. Scenario:** A user has changed their contact information and needs it updated in the system. 

**Solution:** Open ADUC and search for the user account using the search function (searching the entire domain). Open the acccount properties and fill in the updated information in the general, address, and Organization tabs. 

**Verification:** Click Apply and OK. Close and reopen the tab to ensure the changes were saved.
